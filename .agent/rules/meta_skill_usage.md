# Rule: Meta-Skill Usage

- **Mandatory Usage**: Always use the `SkillArchitect` skill whenever creating, modifying, or deleting skills or rules in the project.
- **Consistency**: All new skills must follow the template defined in `skills/SkillArchitect/SKILL.md`.
- **Validation**: No skill should be considered complete until it has a "Security & Privacy" section and a "Verification Plan".
- **Documentation**: Every new skill must be accompanied by an update to the project's internal documentation to inform other agents about its existence.
